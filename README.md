WASD, Space, Shift to move.
Press O to teleport to the center.

After clicking on the canvas, move the mouse to rotate.

Press Enter to add a grain to the center pile, k to add a thousand, and m to add a million.
The program will crash if you add more than 3,657,509 grains.

There are sliders for setting the brightness and opacity.
There are also sliders for setting the colors representing 1-5 grains.

## Known bugs

The `m` button, for adding a million grains, is unacceptably slow.

Depending on your screen size, the sliders might be offscreen.
